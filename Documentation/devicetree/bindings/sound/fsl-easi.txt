* Freescale Enhanced Serial Audio Interface (ESAI)

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "fsl,<chip>-esai".
  - reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device.
  - interrupts: Contains ESAI interrupt.
  - clocks: Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  - fsl,fifo-depth: The number of elements in the transmit and receive FIFOs.
                    This number is the maximum allowed value for TFCR[TFWM].
  - fsl,esai-dma-events: The dma event of the esai, <a b>, a is the tx dma.
			 b is the rx dma.
  - fsl,flags: <1> is for ESAI network mode, <2> is for ESAI SYNC mode.
	       <3> is for network and SYNC mode.

Example:

esai: esai@02024000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-esai";
	reg = <0x02024000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <0 51 0x04>;
	clocks = <&clks 118>;
	fsl,fifo-depth = <128>;
	fsl,esai-dma-events = <24 23>;
	fsl,flags = <1>;
	status = "disabled";
};
